## Extract the data 
I have used Kaggle as a data sourse

## Clean and transform the data
I explore the data to understand the main characteristic of the data, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, generate some insights for further analysis in structure, relationships and distributions. 
For the EDA i will:
Check the dimensions of the dataframe.    
Check for missing values.
Check for duplicate rows. 
Look at the head and tail of the dataframe.    
Look at basic summary statistics for the dataframe.
Check the column name.
Check the data types.
Checking for the outliers.
After cleaning  all the datasets I can group datasets into three categories based on their relevance to each other:
#### Group 1: Economic and Demographic Indicators (summary_unemp_df (Unemployment data), df_population (Population data), df_gdp (GDP data)). 
#### Group 2: Environmental Factors (df_weather_cleaned (Weather data), df_air (Air quality data)). 
#### Group 3: Social and Well-being Factors (combined_df_whr (Combined World Happiness Report data)). We can then merge the datasets within each group based on common features such as country names and years to facilitate the analysis of questions related to each category preferences!

## Analyzing the data.
1. Socio-Economic Indicators
2. Analyzing Social Support Scores
3. Examining Generosity Scores
4. Assessing Freedom to make Life Choices Scores
 
I conducted a n analysis of countries using data of happiness score, life expectancy, air quality, gdp per capita, unemployment data. By using these indicators i focused to identify the countries with the highest hapiness scores, longest life expectances and strongest GDP per capita.
